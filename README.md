# OneSystem-MyHotel

A consumer's journey begins with the selection of a destination and the simultaneous search for a hotel. His guest experience also includes booking interaction and shopping before the stay, interaction with hotel staff during the stay and feedback via social media after the stay. 

Hotel operators face the challenge of providing a personalised guest experience while ensuring effective hotel operations. Modern hotel PMS solutions help hotel operators deliver the desired guest experience without compromising operational efficiency.
